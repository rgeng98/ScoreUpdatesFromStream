# Maple Leafs Score Updates From Stream
I am making this repository to pull live scoring updates from an NHL hockey stream because the APIs are too far behind for me to use it to blare a goal horn in my ear when they score.

I will test this to make sure it works for other teams too if thats your thing, but I will make sure it doesn't work for the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, and Boston Bruins because I make the rules, and I don't like those teams.

You can generate your own training data if you want another team to have a goal horn for, all of that will not be in here. Better documentation coming soon.
